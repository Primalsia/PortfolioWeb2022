## How It's Made:
**Tech Used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Sass

I personalized this template by playing around with CSS, added logos and only kept what was needed for my layout.

## Optimizations
I resized my header logo so when displayed on mobile devices it wouldn't be too big for the screen.

## Lessons Learned:
I had fun tinkering with the template and adding my own personal touch to it. I also heavily used console
